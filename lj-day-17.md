Day 17:  
Today is my second day in the project week.  
Now we as a group has a working drum machine. so what I have worked on today is added Three buttons:  
1. Pause buttons that actually pause the beats we have on till I press the next created button, which is:
2. Play button will actually resume the beats that was previously on before pressing the pause button.  
3. Reset button that when pressed will reset all beats to off as they where never pressed.
