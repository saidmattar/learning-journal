# Said Abdou Mattar day to day coding journey..
Day five : Today I have learned about:  
Domain modeling which is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem.  
Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models:
When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.  
This is really hard for me. I thought I have it down during lecture, but struggled a lot during lab.so need to reread and reread and practice more and more to get it right.
