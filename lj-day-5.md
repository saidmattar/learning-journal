# Said Abdou Mattar day to day coding journey..
Day five : Today I have learned more about:
Understanding of how functions work in JavaScript, as well as the component pieces including declarations, calls, parameters, arguments, and returns.  
Understanding of CSS layout principles including block, inline, normal, relative, absolute, float, and fixed.  
I was successfully pair programming with Timothy, and manage the collaborative and version control aspects of working with Git (from the command line) and GitHub (in the browser).  
Got slightly better at navigating through GIT and GitHub.  
And also getting more and more familiar with moving through an array values.
