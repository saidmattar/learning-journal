Day 2:  
I have learned that across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed, jQuery offers an easy way to do a variety of JavaScript tasks quickly.  
jquery is a function that lets you find one or more elements in the page then apply any of so many methods to it with the least amount of code.  
$() is often used as a shorthand to save typing jQuery().  
The position of <script> elements can affect how quickly a web page seems to load, the ideal location for <script> elements is BEFORE THE CLOSING </body>TAG.  

Day 3:  
I have learned that Using jQuery effects methods can enhance our web pages with transitions and movements.  
Each item returned by  jQuery selector is giving an index, which can be used to filter the selection.  
We can also have a jQuery selection and methods to remove or make a copy of the selected element using:  
.remove() Remove the matched elements from the DOM tree.  
.detach() Same as .remove() but it keeps a copy of the selected elements in memory.  
.empty() Removes child nodes and descendants from elements in matched set.  
We can retrieve or set  Box dimensions by using methods like:  
  .height() & .width()  
But we only can retrieve Box dimensions by using methods like:  
  .innerHeight() & .innerWidth() & .outerHeight() & .outerWidth() &       outerHeight(true) and .outerWidth(true).  
To determine elements position on the page we use:  
  .offset() and .position() methods.  
Hosting the jQuery file could be done by using a version that is hosted by other companies. However we should still include a fallback version.
