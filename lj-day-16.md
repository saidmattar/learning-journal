# Said Abdou Mattar day to day coding journey..
Day 16  
Today is my first day in the project week.  
I am assigned to a group to work on creating a drum machine.  
We all worked together on wire framing and we came up with how we need our drum to be displayed on the screen.  
the we had a driver created our master branch and coded almost everything we need to have a drum on a screen and able to click on cells to add tones and get each one repeated within an interval and delays between beats.  
And we also were able to change the back ground of any clicked cell.  
So we Basically done with our project in one day without styling.  
Since we done and still have time, we set few stretch goals. One of them is to add Pause and Play and Reset buttons on the screen and that is my role for tomorrow.
