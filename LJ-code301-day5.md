# Said Abdou Mattar code fellows 301 coding journey..  
Day 4 and day 5:  
I have learned about Handlebars.js. which is a popular templating engine that is powerful, simple to use and has a large community. With Handlebars, we can separate the generation of HTML from the rest of your JavaScript and write cleaner code.  

The recommended way of adding templates to our page is by including them in <script> tags with a special type. The type attribute is important, otherwise the browser will attempt to parse them as JavaScript (which they are not).  

Handlebars doesnâ€™t allow you to write JavaScript directly within templates. Instead, it gives you helpers. These are JavaScript functions that you can call from your templates, and help you reuse code and create complex templates.  

Block helpers: are just like the regular helpers, but they have an opening and a closing tag (like the #if and #each built-ins). These helpers can modify the HTML and content they are wrapped around. They are a bit more complicated to create, but are very powerful. We can use them to reuse functionality or to create large blocks of HTML in a reusable way (for example lists of items that you use on many places in your app).  
 And in day 5 have learned a lot about Forms but I am struggling to fully get it. but practice practices practice.  
 Stay positive.
