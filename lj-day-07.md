# Said Abdou Mattar day to day coding journey..
Day Seven and Eight: Today I have learned about:
When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
Basically constructors are object's factory that can create products that have similar outputs but with different ingredients. Also learned how to create Tables in JavaScript, was confused at first but getting better at now.
and finally today was able to create forms in JavaScript and by doing that I am able to get data from user to create or ad to new objects that I already have. Even though its still super confusing but after I was done with my assignment today I was thrilled .
practice, practice, practice is the only way to get it right.
