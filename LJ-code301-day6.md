Day 6:  
Today I have learned about Ajax and that  is a technique for loading data into part of a page without having to refresh the page.  
The data is often sent in a javaScript Object Notation (or JSON) format.  
That is how AJAX works:  
  When using Ajax, the browser requests information from a web server. then processes the server's response and shows it within the page.  

to create an Ajax request, browsers use the XMLHttpRequest object. When the server responds to the browser's request, the same XMLHttpRequest object will process the result.  
The response to an Ajax request comes in one of three formats:  
HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language.  
XML: Extensible Markup Language.  
JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.  

The tags in an XML file should describe the data they contain.  
Working with JSON dataa format :  
JSON.stringify() method converts a JavaScript object into a string, formatted using JSON.  
JSON.parse() method processes a string containing JSON data. it converts the JSON data into a JavaScript objects ready for the browser to use. This is called deserializing.  
XML and JSON must be converted into HTML to be shown on a webpage.  

.post() method used to send data to a server.  
.serialize() method is used to collect form data.
