Day 8:  
Today I have learned about Node.js, that is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine, for easily building fast and scalable network applications.  
Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.  
Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.  

Areas where Node.js is proving itself as a perfect technology partner:  
I/O bound Applications  
Data Streaming Applications  
Data Intensive Real-time Applications (DIRT)  
JSON APIs based Applications  
Single Page Applications  
It is not advisable to use Node.js for CPU intensive applications.  

And also learned, SQL or Structured Query Language, which is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.  

A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.  

To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially referred to as queries.  

SQL doesn't require you to write the keywords all capitalized, but as a convention, it helps people distinguish SQL keywords from column and tables names, and makes the query easier to read.  

All strings must be quoted so that the query parser can distinguish words in the string from SQL keywords.
