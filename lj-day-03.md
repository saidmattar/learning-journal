# Said Abdou Mattar day to day coding journey..
Day three : Today I have learned more about:
CSS: Box width, height, overflow, Border, margin, & padding,  Border width,  
 style, & color.  
centering content. Also Changing inline/block, Visibility and Additional border topics (border images, box shadow, border radius). which I  found out that after getting little deeper into these, that CSS is much easier and enjoyable than what I thought.  
Of course practice will make me apple to decide as a developer when to use what!
and how.  
JS "Decisions & Loops" :
 Evaluating conditionals & conditional statements. Comparison operators: evaluating conditions. Structuring comparison operators, Logical operators  
 ‘If’ statements,  ‘If...else’ statements. Truthy & falsy values.  
Checking equality & existence. Loops & loop counters and Looping, Using ‘for’ loop.  
Git Branches & Lab Prep :
I learned and also Created branches in Git and how that integrates into workflow. instead of doing everything in the master branch, and that I should generally never work in master on my own laptop except in specific use cases.

Looking forward to getting to learn more and get more comfortable with using GIT and GitHub.
