# Said Abdou Mattar day to day coding journey..  
Day 12 :I have learned about Charts:  
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.  
A great way to get started with charts is with Charts.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page.  
To display data, the chart must be passed a data object that contains all of the information needed by the chart. The data object can contain the following parameters:  
Name	Type	Description  

There are 4 special global settings that can change all of the fonts on the chart:  
Name	Type	Default	Description.  
At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width (Links to an external site.) and height (Links to an external site.). These are both optional and can also be set using DOM (Links to an external site.)properties (Links to an external site.). When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.  

Learning lots of cool and new tools at a fast pace is definitely challenging and getting a lot out of me. Enjoying the transition a lot.
