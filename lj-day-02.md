# Said Abdou Mattar day to day coding journey.
Days at code fellows:  
Day one: I have learnt the cod of conduct, of course. and lots and lots of information about how to create HTML & CSS and Java script files. and most importantly how to link them together. also learnt about GIT and GitHub and that they are two different things, and a little about how to use them and was confused about what's going on, or how to make a use of them.  
Day two: learnt more about GIT and GitHub. was super confused still. but during lab I have gotten lots of help from Megan, who is my class mate, really helpful. thanks Megan.  
and also all TAs are awesome, they cleared up lots of mixed up concepts about how to use GIT and GitHub!  
working on an assignment that includes   html & java script and CSS files created directly from GIT and using ATOM to write the cods. then push the final products to GitHub.  
still have little confusion about things or I think its matter of time before I feel comfortable navigating between the GIT and uploading cods or files to GitHub.
