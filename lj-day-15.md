# Said Abdou Mattar day to day coding journey..  
Day 14:I have learned about Charts:  

With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.  

Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and yaxes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth.  

Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.  
It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example.  
With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.  
The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move. Knowing the duration from the transition-duration property a transition can have multiple speeds within a single duration. A few of the more popular keyword values for the transition-timing-function property include linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.  
Here are 8 really simple effects that will add life to your UI and smiles to your usersâ€™ faces:  

FADE IN.
CHANGE COLOR.
GROW AND SHRINK.
ROTATE ELEMENTS.
SQUARE TO CIRCLE.
3D SHADOW.
SWING.
INSERT BORDER. Day 15 I have learned a little about inheritance and also deploying websites and also how to deal with merges and merge conflicts. really really beneficial stuff.
