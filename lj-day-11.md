# Said Abdou Mattar day to day coding journey..  
Day 11 :I have learned about:
Adding video or audio to  web pages done by one of three commonly taken routes:
Use a hosted service & Use flash and Use HTML5.  
The most popular way of adding flash into a webpage is using JavaScript.  
The Script we will be looking at here is called SWFObject , you can obtain a free copy from google.  
Steps need to be followed to add a flash video to your page:  
Convert your video into FLV format & Find an FLV player to play the video and Include the player and the video in your page.  
But also Using a flash is no longer the way to do it so the next one is:  
Adding video to your page using the HTML <video> element, this element has number of attributes which allow you to control video playback, they are:  
src  
poster  
width,height  
controls  
autoplay
loop  
preload, this attribute tells the browser what to do when the page loads. It can have one of three values:  
none. auto. metadata  
We can use CSS to specify the dimensions of images on the web page. And to align them horizontally and vertically.  
Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.  
Still a lot to do and practice, practice, practice.
