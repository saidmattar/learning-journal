# Said Abdou Mattar day to day coding journey..
Day 09 and 10 :I have learned about:
CSS lay outs and the events.
The CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box.

These boxes are either:  
block-level-element, these start on a new line.
Inline elements, these flow in between surrounding text.
The CSS callow us to control the layout of a page by having Positioning schemes:  
Normal flow. Relative & Absolute positioning & Fixed  positioning and Floating elements.  
Controlling positioned elements can be done bye using the z-index to control which element sits on the top.  
We can include multiple CSS files in one page.
Form: Is where we collect information from users. And it lives inside a <form> element.  
The information from a form are name/value pairs.
The  style or of a bullet point in a list is controlled by  The list-style-type property.
bullets also could be specified as images by using list-style-image property.
Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but we can use some properties to make them more consistent.
Styling forms make them feel more interactive.  

Still need to practice a lot to get better at using CSS to move my Boxes around..
